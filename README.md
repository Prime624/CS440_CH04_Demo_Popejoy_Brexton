I chose the BSD license because it is, in my opinion, the most flexible and useful license. I retain complete ownership and control over the software, but people are free to use it however they like, be it commercial or public. This makes it so that it doesn't restrict people who may want to make money off of their work, which is a valid concern. Additionally, I do not have any liability or responsibility for the software.
